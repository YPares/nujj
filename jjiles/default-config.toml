##
## These settings will be overriden by those in your user jj config.toml
## (`$HOME/.config/jj/config.toml`), and then by those in your local
## repository config.toml (`.jj/repo/config.toml`). So if you want per-repo
## color settings, keybindings, etc, JJ has you covered.
##
## You can copy them to your JJ config as a starting point.

## Watcher settings. This is meant to be configured per repository,
## and can be repeated for each folder in the repository to watch
#[[jjiles.watched]]
##
## The path (relative to project root) to watch:
#folder = "src"
##
## A glob pattern. Which files should be watched for changes in this folder
## (all by default):
#pattern = "**/*.rs" 
##
## A list of glob patterns. Any path matching an entry should be ignored when
## modified (empty by default). Additionally, any path matching an entry in
## one of your .gitignore files will be ignored:
#ignore = ["**/*.bck"]

## Fetcher settings. This is meant to be configured per repository,
## and can be repeated for each git remote to fetch regularly
#[[jjiles.fetched]]
##
## The remote to fetch:
#remote = "origin"
##
## A list of glob patterns. Which branches to fetch from this remote.
## Will fetch everything if not specified:
#branches = ["*"]
##
## How often should we fetch it. It should be parseable as a nushell duration type.
## Will default to 5min if not specified:
#every = "1min"

## Global layout settings:
[jjiles.interface]
## Which fzf style to use (minimal, default or full):
fzf-style = "default"
## Where to place the header (showing the breadcrumbs) and the search bar:
menu-position = "top"
## Whether the evolog is browsable by default or not:
evolog-toggled-on = false
## Whether the search bar is visible by default or not:
show-searchbar = true
## Whether the keybidings are shown or not:
show-keybindings = true
## Whether to wrap long lines in the preview panel by default:
preview-line-wrapping = false

## Which style of borders to draw around the various elements of the interface.
## See `man fzf` for more info:
[jjiles.interface.borders]
header = "sharp"
input = "none"
list = "none"
preview = "line"

## Which JJ templates are to be used by jjiles:
[jjiles.templates]
## The JJ template to be used by the OpLog view, and applied for each operation listed.
## If not set, will default to the 'templates.op_log' of your jj config, to stick to
## the behaviour of 'jj op log':
#op_log = "builtin_op_log_compact"
 
## The JJ template to be used by the RevLog view, and applied for each revision listed.
## If not set, will default to the 'templates.log' of your jj config, to stick to
## the behaviour of 'jj log':
#rev_log = "builtin_log_compact"

## The JJ template to be used by the EvoLog view, and applied for each commit listed.
## If not set, will default to the 'templates.log' of your jj config, to stick to
## the behaviour of 'jj evolog':
#evo_log = "builtin_log_compact"

## The JJ template to be used as a header in the side panel when previewing a revision
## (from the RevLog view).
##
## `config("width")` is provided by jjiles and corresponds to the width (in characters) of
## the panel in which the template will be used
rev_preview = '''
  builtin_log_detailed ++ diff.stat(config("width").as_integer())
'''

## The JJ template to be used as a header in the side panel when previewing a commit
## (from the EvoLog view):
evo_preview = '''
  builtin_log_detailed ++ diff.summary()
'''

## The JJ template to be used as a header in the side panel when previewing a specific
## file diff from a specific revision/commit (from the Files view):
##
## `%FILE%` will be replaced by jjiles with the file currently being previewed. It cannot
## be passed via `config` (like width) because the diff function expects a string literal:
file_preview = '''
  builtin_log_oneline ++ "\n" ++ self.diff(%FILE%).summary()
'''

## Control how the diffs (in the preview panel) will be rendered:
[jjiles.diff]
## JJiles default behaviour is to generate single-column diffs, and to switch
## to double-column when it has enough space (ie. when the preview panel has at
## least a certain width, in number of characters per line). This parameter
## defines that width threshold. If you don't like double-column diffs,
## just set it to some arbitrary high number:
double-column-threshold = 160

## Colors used in the rest of the config can be a key in the 'theme-mappings'
## section below. In such case, the final color will depend on system
## theme. This is for users who want their configuration to look OK whatever
## the system theme:
[jjiles.colors.theme-mappings]
opaque.dark = "black" ## if system theme is "dark", "opaque" will be replaced by "black"
opaque.light = "white"
## No default. If the system theme cannot be detected, every setting using
## "opaque" will be ignored

high-contrast.dark = "#ffffff"
high-contrast.light = "#000000"
high-contrast.default = "#888888" ## here we provide a default to use if the system theme cannot be detected

low-contrast.dark = "#373737"
low-contrast.light = "#dfdfdf"

## Important: the colors in this section are not for fzf. They need to be valid ansi colors
## See nushell command `ansi --list`:
[jjiles.colors.elements]
filepath = "yellow" # The color of the "Files" view and of the file paths displayed in that view

## Colors will be passed to fzf --color, after being potentially remapped first.
## See `man fzf` for more info:
[jjiles.colors.fzf]
header-border = "low-contrast"
header-bg = "opaque"
preview-border = "high-contrast"
preview-bg = "opaque"
list-border = "cyan"
pointer = "high-contrast"

## Bindings will be passed straight to fzf --bind.  Note that if you add
## mappings for keys that conflict with the main jjiles keybindings (those
## directly defined in jjiles' code, which are not remappable), jjiles will
## show an error when starting.
##
## See `man fzf` for more info:
[jjiles.bindings.fzf]
## Clear searchbar, or (if already empty) qui without printing anything:
"ctrl-c" = "cancel"
## Quit and print the currently selected commit/operation:
"ctrl-q,ctrl-g" = "accept"
## Scroll log list with mouse wheel (repeated to scroll faster):
scroll-up = "offset-up+offset-up+offset-up"
scroll-down = "offset-down+offset-down+offset-down"
## Scroll preview panel with mouse wheel (repeated to scroll faster):
preview-scroll-up = "preview-up+preview-up+preview-up"
preview-scroll-down = "preview-down+preview-down+preview-down"
## Page up/down in log list:
"alt-down,alt-j" = "page-down"
"alt-up,alt-k" = "page-up"
## First/last line in log list:
"alt-left,alt-h" = "first"
"alt-right,alt-l" = "last"
## Page up/down in preview panel:
page-down = "preview-page-down"
page-up = "preview-page-up"
## Scroll by half a page in preview panel:
ctrl-d = "preview-half-page-down"
ctrl-u = "preview-half-page-up"
## Toggle the wrapping of long lines in the preview panel:
ctrl-w = "toggle-preview-wrap"
